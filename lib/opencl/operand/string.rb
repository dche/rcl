  # Include a common OpenCL utility module. The effect of this method is
  # read the contents of a OpenCL source file from a predefined

  # append the contents to the receiver.

  # For example, you want to use a random generator in your kernel, so
  # you reference the RNG methods in your kernel source code.
  # Before you build the program with source, you need
  # call your kernel string variable's +rcl_include+ method, with the
  # arguemnt +'random'+, which is the file name that defines the RNG methods.
